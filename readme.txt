Notes about wbfs_win
--------------------

wbfs_win is a command line utility that can be used both from GUI and WBFS Gui:

http://www.elotrolado.net/hilo_yal-juegos-sin-usbloader-desde-homebrew-channel_1213714

The utility have some changes that allows to extract a .ciso by default (if you rename it to .iso it will also work on another GUIs that
 force file type), so we can save some GB in the disc; upload both .iso and .ciso, and the possibility to add an icon to the uploaded iso.

It also supports iso extraction using "isoextract" command (see readme_new.txt)


To add an icon:

wbfs_win.exe Z png RSPP01 HBC_icon_WiiSports.png

Where:

 -Z is the drive letter
 -png is the command
 -RSPP01 is wiisports id
 -HBC_icon_WiiSports.png png file

PNG file size must be less than 200KB, but it's much better if it's less than 100KB, because it will directly affect main screen's load times.

Both width and height are better if divisible by 16 to avoid problems with textures, and lot better if dimensions are at most 256x192. 
My recommendation is a size of 128x96 average.

If you have doubts, please ask in the forums.

Remember, you have now one option to upload icons from the SD on uLoader 
application

Some elotrolado.net users have uploaded a lot of icons from here:

http://www.elotrolado.net/wiki/Iconos_de_juegos_para_uLoader

(save the page content to get alls icons quickly)

ALTERNATIVE DOL NOTES
---------------------

NOTE: Old alternative dol method is unsupported now

- Press HOME (pointing one game)

- Press PLUS to change the page and enter in "altertanive.dol"

- if you can see it you can delete the alternative dol using "Delete Alternative .dol"

- Press "Search .dol" to find alternative dols

- Select one (if it find one, of course)

NOTE: it can list 5 dols only, but i think it is sufficient at the momment (normally it find one or none). When you select one, it is saved 
in the _CFG_ WBFS file created by uLoader. It support 1024 games

NOTE2: Of course, when you "delete alternative .dol" it delete the list entry in _CFG_ and not 
delete the .dol :P

NOTE3: You can delete the olds sd:/games or usb:/games directories

Operational Mode for EHCI Driver
---------------------------------

- Device Mount: frontal LED frontal on from a second and when it finish LED off

- Mounting device fail or non recoverable error: frontal LED blinking slowly

- Unit Mounted disconnected: frontal LED bliking 3 times and LED off in secuence

- Device mismatch (different device): fast frontal LED blinking

- Interrupt support to free devices as USB 1.1 for others ports (remember you port 0 is always for USB 2.0 operations)

Mode DVD USB
------------

At Start:

- Run uLoader with a DVD device connected in the USB port and put a disc.
  
  1- while the device is waiting to be mounted it display the next message "ERROR: Can't Mount Device". 
 
  2- if it use expensive time to get the DVD, maybe the DVD device can´t read the disc (unknown format or other problem). Try reconnect the DVD device
     or change the disc by other.

  3- if it display "ERROR: DVD Device Sector Size must be 2048 bytes" you are using a bad format disc (for example CD audio XD)


In the DVD screen loader:

- It work exactly as DVD Wii device: You can eject and change the disc as you want from the new device

NOTE: in this mode you can´t load disc from the DVD Wii device how it is obvious
